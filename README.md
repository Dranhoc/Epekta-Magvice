# Magvice — Front-End Showcase Website

This repository contains the front-end implementation of **Magvice**, a showcase website developed during my internship at **Epekta**, a creative branding and web agency.

The project was discontinued by the client after the homepage was completed, but the codebase reflects the full front-end approach, tooling, and collaboration workflow used during the project.
